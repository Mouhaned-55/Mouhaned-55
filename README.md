# Hey there, I'm Mouhaned Akermi 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate mobile developer specializing in Kotlin, Flutter, and Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (KMM), and I'm on a mission to create beautiful and functional mobile apps. With 3 years of hands-on experience, I bring a fresh perspective and a wealth of knowledge to the table, all while being just 22 years old.

🚀 Here's what you should know about me:

## 📱 Mobile App Magician
I breathe life into ideas by transforming them into stunning mobile apps. My toolset includes Swift, Kotlin, Flutter, React Native, and a touch of pure magic.

## 💻 Kotlin Aficionado
Kotlin is my second language - not just because it's the one I code with, but because I love every aspect of it. From concise syntax to null safety, I'm all in when it comes to leveraging the power of Kotlin for Android development.

## 🌟 Flutter Enthusiast
Flutter is my go-to for crafting cross-platform magic. I'm all about creating stunning UIs that work seamlessly on both Android and iOS. Flutter is not just a framework; it's a canvas for my creative ideas.

## 🌐 Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (KMM)
I'm not just bound to one platform—I also wield the power of Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (KMM) to build efficient, cross-platform apps that save time and resources.

## 💡 Innovative Problem Solver
I love tackling challenges head-on and finding creative solutions to problems. Debugging is like a puzzle to me, and I won't rest until I've cracked it.

## 🎨 User-Centric Design Enthusiast
User interfaces and user experiences are my playground. I obsess over pixel-perfect designs and smooth animations to create apps that users will love.

## 🎓 Experienced Beyond My Years
Despite my young age, I've been in the mobile development game for 3 years, working on a wide range of projects that have honed my skills and given me insights that are well beyond my years.

## 🌐 Open Source Advocate
I believe in giving back to the developer community. You can find some of my open-source contributions right here on GitHub.

## 🏢 Proudly Working at Softylines
